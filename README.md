# flextools
I have a very "opinionated" preference for flexbox, and against bootstrap. However, that makes absolutely no sense unless I can easily provide functionality in flex that I could also easily provide with bootstrap. That is the purpose of this project. Over time, I will (hopefully) expound on that preference, and either build up a viable toolbox, give up and use bootstrap, wait for the next bootstrap version (which is supposed to provide flex support,  but may or may not be built around flex), or something else entirely.

TODO:

1. explain basis for preference
1. provide initial list of functionality to replicate
1. provide programming/code-review guidelines
1. provide roadmap for broader goals/technologies
