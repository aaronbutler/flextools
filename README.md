# flextools
I have a very "opinionated" preference for flexbox, and against bootstrap. However, that makes absolutely no sense unless I can easily provide functionality in flex that I could also easily provide with bootstrap. That is the purpose of this project. Over time, I will (hopefully) expound on that preference, and either build up a viable toolbox, give up and use bootstrap, wait for the next bootstrap version (which is supposed to provide flex support,  but may or may not be built around flex), or something else entirely.

## Why flex?

1. It is usually reasonable to write flex-based code without using artificial container html elements.
1. Flex doesn't get in the way of applications. Bootstrap is great for webpages, but it makes it hard to write apps. Everything's coming up appy.

## Bootstrap functionality to rewrite as flex:

1. Main nav menu that collapses to hamburger on small screens
1. Modal/popup, ideally pure css
1. accordion list

## Roadmap
For the time being, I will implement all tools with minimmal functionality. As I use them in projects, I will (hopefully) learn what style patterns I should include in the underlying tools.

TODO:

1. explain basis for preference
1. provide initial list of functionality to replicate
1. provide programming/code-review guidelines
1. provide roadmap for broader goals/technologies
